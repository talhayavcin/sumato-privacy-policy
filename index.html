<h1>Privacy Policy for Sumato</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

<p>Thank you for using <strong>Sumato</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Sumato mobile application (the “App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1. Device Information</h3>
<p>We collect a unique device identifier (Device ID) for analytics, app performance, usage tracking, and preventing abuse. This identifier cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>

<h3>1.2. Uploaded Content (Photos, Text, Files)</h3>
<p>To generate summaries, notes, or quiz content, you may upload photos from your gallery, take photos using your camera, or submit text/files. This content is securely sent to the OpenAI API only to generate results. It is not used to train AI models and is not stored by third parties.</p>

<h3>1.3. Non-Personal User Data Stored in Firebase</h3>
<p>We use Firebase to store non-personal metadata, app usage information, saved content (if you choose to save it), and subscription/account status. We do not store any personal information that directly identifies you unless you voluntarily include it inside content you upload.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use collected data to provide AI-powered features, improve app performance, process uploaded content, manage subscriptions, and ensure secure and fair usage. Your data is not sold or shared with third parties for advertising.</p>

<h2>3. How Uploaded Content Is Handled</h2>
<p>Your photos or text are transmitted securely to OpenAI solely for processing. They are not stored or reused. You may delete your saved content at any time in the App.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may delete saved data within the App or request deletion by contacting us.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be shown with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>
